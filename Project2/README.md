# Project Description

This project investigated the impact of different data properties on the performance of machine learning models for detecting pneumonia in children's chest x-ray images using AWS Rekognition. Four models were trained on different datasets: a balanced dataset of 100 images from each class, an unbalanced dataset with 100 images from the "normal" class and 200 images from the "pneumonia" class, a dataset with 30% of the data mislabeled, and a dataset with three classes: "normal", "bacterial pneumonia", and "viral pneumonia". The models were evaluated using a confusion matrix and precision and recall metrics. The results showed that the size and balance of the dataset, as well as the presence of dirty data, can have a significant impact on the performance of machine learning models.
