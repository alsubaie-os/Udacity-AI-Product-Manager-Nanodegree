# Project 1 : Create a Medical Image Annotation Job

This project involved designing a data labeling job on Appen's platform to create a labeled dataset of chest x-ray images that can be used to train a machine learning model to detect pneumonia in children. The dataset includes images of healthy and pneumonia-affected lungs, and the job instructions and example test questions are designed to help non-experts identify the symptoms of pneumonia. The project also discusses the design choices and methods for quality assurance that were used to create the dataset.

# Project 2 : Build a Model With AWS Rekognition

This project investigated the impact of different data properties on the performance of machine learning models for detecting pneumonia in children's chest x-ray images using AWS Rekognition. Four models were trained on different datasets: a balanced dataset of 100 images from each class, an unbalanced dataset with 100 images from the "normal" class and 200 images from the "pneumonia" class, a dataset with 30% of the data mislabeled, and a dataset with three classes: "normal", "bacterial pneumonia", and "viral pneumonia". The models were evaluated using a confusion matrix and precision and recall metrics. The results showed that the size and balance of the dataset, as well as the presence of dirty data, can have a significant impact on the performance of machine learning models.

This project is designed to test your ability to:

- Build a model using AWS Rekognition.
- Understand how properties of data impact performance of models.

# Project 3 : Create an AI Product Business Proposal

This project is about developing a business proposal for an AI product. We will need to think about and describe several important aspects of product development, such as the product's target market, its features, and its competitive landscape. This project is open-ended in that we can propose any product in any industry that we want.

### Here are some of the specific steps that we will need to take in order to complete this project

#### 1- Define the problem that the AI product will solve

- What is the pain point that the product will address? What are the unmet needs of the target market?

#### 2- Research the competitive landscape

- What other AI products are available in the market? What are their strengths and weaknesses?

#### 3- Develop a product roadmap

- What features will the product have? How will it be developed and delivered?

#### 4- Create a business case

- What is the market size for the product? What are the costs of development and marketing? What are the expected returns?

#### 5- Write a business proposal

- This document will outline the project in detail and explain why it is a good investment.
