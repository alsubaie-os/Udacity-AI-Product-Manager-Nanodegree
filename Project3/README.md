# Project Description

This project is a proposal for an AI product that will use ML to identify fraud transactions based on the victims' behavior and their common qualities. ML algorithms can be trained on data from past fraud cases to identify fraud transactions based on the victims' behavior and qualities. This information can then be used to develop new fraud transaction detection models that can be used to identify potential fraud transactions and block them.
