# Project Description

This project involved designing a data labeling job on Appen's platform to create a labeled dataset of chest x-ray images that can be used to train a machine learning model to detect pneumonia in children. The dataset includes images of healthy and pneumonia-affected lungs, and the job instructions and example test questions are designed to help non-experts identify the symptoms of pneumonia. The project also discusses the design choices and methods for quality assurance that were used to create the dataset.
